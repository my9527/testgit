Tether uses smart contract to issue, hold and transfer USDT on the TRON blockchain.  ¬† From April 30th to August 7th, TRON has organized and prepared a bonus return (paid by USDT-TRON) activity with high rate of annualized returns to encourage users to convert USDT-OMNI into USDT-TRON. The activity will last until the early August. During the activity period, the USDT-TRON holders will get airdrop as bonus returns and the highest annualized rate of the return is up to 20%.  KuCoin will offer full support to this activity and users transferring USDT into this activity will get the corresponding bonus returns based on the USDT amount. KuCoin will convert the USDT-OMNI and USDT-ERC20 into USDT-TRON and the TRON will release the bonus rewards as airdrops to users through KuCoin.  <br/><br/>(1) In this activity, you could transfer in/out your USDT at your convenience.  <br/><br/>(2) At 24:00(UTC+8) each day, KuCoin will take a snapshot of the USDT-TRON amount hold by users and calculate the corresponding bonus returns based on the USDT-TRON amount and the return rate of the day.   <br/><br/>(3) The calculation of the return by 24:00(UTC+8) each day is based on the amount of USDT users transferred in before 16:00(UTC+8) that day.   <br/><br/>(4) From 16:00(UTC+8) to 24:00(UTC+8) each day, if your total USDT-TRON amount increases, the increased part will be used for the return calculation of the next day at 24:00(UTC+8) and will not be used for the bonus return calculation of the day. Therefore, we suggest you to transfer in USDT before 16:00(UTC+8) each day to get more bonus returns.  <br/><br/>(5)Your bonus returns will be transferred into this activity directly.
